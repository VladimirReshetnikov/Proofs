namespace PresburgerArithmetic

/-! A small, executable syntax for first-order Presburger arithmetic over `ℤ`.

An affine expression is stored as a constant and a (possibly short) list of
coefficients.  Missing coefficients are zero.  Quantifiers use de Bruijn
indices: the newly bound integer is consed onto the valuation.
