`src/Lean/` is a repository-local Lake workspace for Lean proofs that are
not owned by one of the more specialized subprojects.

The initial module,
[`LeanProofs/FermatFour.lean`](LeanProofs/FermatFour.lean), records the
`n = 4` special case of Fermat's Last Theorem:

```lean
theorem fermat_four_no_positive_nat_solutions
    {a b c : Nat} (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) (hc : 0 < c) :
    a ^ 4 + b ^ 4 ≠ c ^ 4
```

This is the positive-natural-number form of the statement that there are no
positive integers satisfying `a^4 + b^4 = c^4`. The same module also records
the stronger integer descent statement `a^4 + b^4 != c^2`, which is the
classical route to Fermat's `n = 4` case.
